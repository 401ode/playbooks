Notes

1	Design Strategy	We need a document \(a la Digital by Default\) that outlines how we desire projects to be conceived, planned, and executed, with particular emphasis on agile, iterative delivery.	Must have	

2	 Electronic Payments	We need specific language detailing the charges that we are willing to accept from a vendor \(threshold?\) related to electronic payment processing.  We have an agreement with RII for costs related to payment processing and need to make it clear that potential vendors must explain the costs \(fees\) associated with using them as a payment processor. 	



3	MBE Requirements	We need a template that explains how MBE points will be allocated to/earned by a potential vendor and directions for complying with our MBE statute.  This process is often confusing for the vendor and agency representatives and it need not be. An argument could be made that an MBE partner should be MANDATORY as an eligibility requirement, and the RFP should include a link to the State MBE page, directing each bidder to contact one or more certified MBEs and select one to include on their proposal so that no advantage is gained by any one bidder solely for having an established partnership.	



4	SLA/uptime	We need a template for SaaS and other related solutions to set expectations for uptime/response time/service from our vendors and also what penalities will be associated with noncompliance.	



 5	Long-term view \(this speaks to \#1 above\)	Strategic initiatives for statewide platforms \(e.g. permitting\) must demand that bidders respond to our vision in their proposal.  If we want to launch a pilot in ten communities, we should already know the potential costs \(or at least the financial model\) we can expect from a vendor over the long term.  We can no longer award a contract based on the Year 1 or Phase 1 costs.  If we already know what the long term plan is, we should know what the long term costs may be and share the risks of pursuing the long term vision with our vendor.  The scoring for cost models should include a \(perhaps evenly weighted\) break down of A\)implementation/short term/go live costs and B\)roll-out/long term/Phase X costs \(which should also be optional so that the state is not tied to a vendor whose product does not keep up with industry standards\).  This will require more work on the part of the RFP development team \(to determine cost models, and if necessary, provide flexibility within those cost models while still allowing us to score them comparatively\).	



6 	Gradual economies of scale	Statewide initiatives should benefit from economies of scale.  Phase 1 may or may not include all commuities, so there will be fewer incentives for the vendor to offer the best price from go-live.  We must acknowledge this fact in our RFPs and request that the vendor provide a scaled cost model that considers the potential additional revenue that will be won in future Phases, while also sharing some of the cost savings with the state. 	



7	Electronic Submissions	Clarify which components of a proposal must be submitted \(perhaps in addition to a PDF or perhaps solely\) in electronic format and what the file format should be.  Some work needs to be done with Purchasing to identify/create an online portal/dropbox where electronic file submissions can be made so we can avoid requiring bidders to submit digital media storage, and the list of files requested should be highlighted in the Completion Check List \(see \#8 below\).	



8	Completion Cover page/instructions/ Check list	Machine readable digital file formats and Surety Bonds are two examples of omissions that bidders have forgotten or misunderstood were required as part of their bid package during recent months. Sometimes these omissions result in the disqualification of a bid, even though the rest of the bid is complete.  Designing a new cover page or instruction sheet with a check list or requiring vendors who submit bids to complete an online questionnaire that can highlight requirements they may have forgotten are two ways to avoid these omissions.  Any requirements that can void a proposal if omitted should be included \(at a minimum\) in this list.	



9	Expectation of cross-vendor collaboration and data accessibility	Include a statement speaking to the following idea: "Proposals responding to this RFP must state a commitment to working collaboratively with other current State vendors to integrate with their systems and/or allow access to data belonging to the State that may come to be stored in any system or database owned by the bidder in order to facilitate the most efficent data transfer processes possible or to make machine-readable public data easily accessible."	



10	Timelines	It is conceivable that a vendor's capability/work plan may be judged by the length of the proposed project \(time to go-live\).  In such cases, the RFP should clearly state that the project timeline should be included as part of the Work Plan documentation.  This should also be included in the "check list" referenced above. Additionally there should be documentation of what should trigger a change request, related to timelines or other scope deviations. It may be determined that this should be part of the contract, and does not necessarily need to be in the RFP itself, but it should be understood by both parties, before project launch, that there are certain Project Change Control Rules. At a minimum, the contract must determine and document the ground rules for processing project change controls by establishing thresholds for reporting and obtaining approvals of changes. For example, Change Control rules may include: schedule-if the project dates are delayed or accelerated by more than 10% of the project elapsed times or by two weeks \(whichever is less\), or budget \(purchases, hours, and dollars\)-the cumulative amount of changes equal to or in excess of 10% over/under budget or 100 hours, whichever is less.	



11	Incorporate video screen capture into RFP and Proposal Request	Utilizing screen capture software could go a long ways towards improving the amount of information available to both vendors and PRTs.  First, during the development of the RFP, screen capture software could be utilized to record a user demonstrating or explaining the functionality that must be improved or developed.  Then we could demand in return that a vendor utilize screen capture software to demonstrate their ability to deliver on the RFP requirements.  A series of videos explaining requirements and a series of videos in response from each vendor meeting those requirements will result in a much more specific, clear representation of what can be delivered. 	



12	Build in multi-stage scoring	Traditional RFPs might only have a "technical requirements" section and a "cost proposal" section.  PRTs are required to invite all vendors to demonstrate their product unless there is some cutoff point.  If there is no described threshold that must be met before a demonstration opportunity is offered to any vendor, all vendors must be invited.  With the assistance of the screen capture video, a PRT should be capable of assessing the ability of the software to meet required thresholds and cut the vendors that do not.  Remaining vendors can be invited to demonstrate further, if desired.	



13	Sandbox Access to a System	Should we request sandbox access to a dummy system as part of our RFP or in conjunction with our requirement that we be able to see exactly how the system looks, feels and operates when executing certain commands?  What about a dummy login to an app so we can see what functionality exists in comparison to the full version? 	



14	Request vendor and offering attributes	

Financial stability of organization

support structure and response time

training model \(included? cost model? types/levels of training?\)

how do they handle upgrade costs/enhancements, etc?







15	Bonds	RFP Authors must be well versed in the differences between Bid Bonds, Performance Bonds and Purchase Bonds.  The State must have a consistent policy regarding which types of bonds will be requested of vendors, depending on the nature of the RFP.  In addition to policies describing the type of bond, the duration that the bond will be held, either during vendor selection or project implementation \(depending on the bond\) must be clearly stated.  A bid bond term may potentially impact the timeline of the vendor selection process.  A performance bond needs to be described as being renewable or not, and for what terms. 	



16	RFP vs IFB	At a basic level, individuals involved in procurement should understand the difference between a Request for Proposals and an Invitation for Bids.	



17	Landscape of public opening vs. private	It would be nice to discover how common it is for governments at the various levels \(municipal/state\) to conduct their evaluation of proposals before making any of the proposals public. 	



18	Variability of cost per year over multi-year contracts	

This may or may not be an issue, but we may want to consider requiring or requesting that a vendor limit the variability of costs across the years of a multi-year project.  For example, if we state that a proposal will be evaluated over a four year contract, Vendor A might bid $4,000,000 and vendor B might bid $4,200,000.  Vendor A would win the contract, even if their cost model stated that they would require $3,700,000 for the first year and $100,000 each of the following three years.  Case in point, below is the actual cost model for the top two vendors for the Time, Leave and Attendance project currently being implemented:

 

Because of the high cost of the first vendor, the second vendor actually is cheaper in the first two years, but the State would be in a better financial position if the $2.6 million were more evenly spread across the years.  Requiring that there be no more than 25% variability across the years would better balance the financial burden on the State.





19	Cost proposal details/structure and Professional Services	

RFP should specify whether or not there are expectations that any fixed price quoted will include any additonal costs that could reasonably be associated with the project.  For example, if any hardware associated with the use of the project has a variable cost, a reasonable estimate should be provided.  Professional services may include travel time and associated expenses and the proposal must clarify whether these costs are also included/fixed in the cost proposal submitted in response to the RFP.

Often the implementation costs that are proposed by a vendor do not include any migration or conversion of data. It is important to request costs for moving data from a legacy system, including all components of that data, or at least have a clear understanding of the hourly rate that will be charged for such an effort. Implementation costs can quickly balloon because of the need to preserve access to historical records.





20	Specification of "Capability" vs Standard	If a vendor claims their solution offers a capability by indicating such in a business requirements matrix, consider requesting that the vendor additionally specify whether that capability is offered with all associated features as part of the cost structure that is included with the proposal. If the capability is not offered as part of their proposal costs, then request that the cost structure include pricing related to those capabilities/features. We must do what we can to avoid tentatively selecting a vendor who explains during the contract negotiation process that, "yes, we offer that capability, but it costs extra." This also highlights the importance of making a distinction between required functionality \(which should definitely be in the cost proposal\) and "preferred" functionality, and how those will be weighed between vendors. We may not be able to make a distinction between vendors for costs of "preferred" functionality, so we need to be careful about what is labeled as "required" vs. "preferred" in our RFP.	



Proposal Review Pointers

Once your RFP has been successfully developed, released and responded to, this information might be helpful in the review process. 

1\) Understand your audience: Some members of your PRT might have expertise in business requirements, but not in technical features.  Asking each member to score the entire proposal might not be the best approach.  By matching PRT members up with the parts of the proposal where they are most capable of scoring accurately, the quality of the scores can be guaranteed and unnecessary confusion can be avoided. 

2\) When you are about to review bids/proposals in response to an RFP, Purchasing requests that you send them 1\) a list of your review team members with their titles and 2\)  A Conflict of Interest Certificate signed by each of the review team members \(as per Purchasing Department's request\).
