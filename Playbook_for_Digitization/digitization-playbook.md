_Putting down my initial thoughts on "Things an Agency Should Know or Have to Remove Paper"_

#### For an agency

* **Identify Champions -** contacts that are on the ground with the issue and decision makers that have ability to make decisions
* **Identify Projects and Priorities -** Identify how a digitization project ranks in concert with other agency activities. Capital Budget process can serve as reference and template
* **Agree on terms - **Digital, electronic, process, internal, open are all terms that should be understood for a project
* **User feedback** meetings and information
* **Lean partner and business process identification** - understanding the business process and mapping out the process and obstacles
* **Create Statement of work **- 
* Work cross referenced to "Combined Inventory Report" and " IT FY Budget Priorities"
* **Identify Funding** - 
* **Intent to digitize submitted -   **
* **Staff, capital /equipment identified  **
* **Timeline created  **
* Legislation related to files - Need a copy, need to be open \(What does open mean definition\)
* Destruction form of old records
