STATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION CENTER SECTION 7.13
The State Chief Information Officer (CIO) may operate a State Information Technology Innovation Center (Center) to develop and demonstrate technology solutions with potential benefit to the State and its citizens. The Center may facilitate the piloting of potential solutions to State technology requirements. In operating the Center, the State CIO shall ensure that all State laws, rules, and policies are followed. Vendor participation in the Center shall not be construed to (i) create any type of preferred status for vendors or (ii) abrogate the requirement that the State CIO ensure that agency and statewide requirements for information technology support (including those for the Office of the State CIO and the Office of Information Technology Services) are awarded based on a competitive process that follows information technology procurement guidelines. Beginning July 1, 2013, the State CIO shall report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology on a quarterly basis on initiatives being developed and implemented within the Center, as well as on the sources and amounts of resources used to support the Center.
